#🎮 Rock, Paper, Scissors Game – Python Mini Project

Hey there! 👋
I'm currently diving into basic Python projects to strengthen my foundations step by step. This simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game is one of my early projects — and just the beginning of my learning journey! 🚀

As I continue to grow my skills, I’ll be exploring more advanced topics in Python, Data Science, and Machine Learning. Stay tuned for more exciting projects!

🔧 What this project includes:

A fun, interactive command-line game

Basic use of Python functions and control flow

Randomized computer choices

User input handling and game result logic
